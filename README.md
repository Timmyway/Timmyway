- 👋 Hi, I’m @Timmyway. I'm a passionate web developer. I love to learn new things.

- 👀 I’m interested in creating web application, site and interface. My favorite language is by far Python, but I often use PHP and Javascript (Vue) according to the projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on Laravel and Vue.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of web project.
